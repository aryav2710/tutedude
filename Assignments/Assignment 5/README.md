# Python Programs for Dictionary and List Slicing

## Description
This repository contains two Python programs:

### 1. Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
This program:
- Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
- Asks the user to input a student's name.
- Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
- If the studentâ€™s name is not found, displays an appropriate message.

### 2. Demonstrate List Slicing
This program:
- Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extracts the first five elements from the list.
- Reverses these extracted elements.
- Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3 recommended).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```sh
   python filename.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter the required inputs.
5. The program will display the respective outputs.

## Example Usage
### Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
```
Enter the student's name: Alice
Alice's marks: 90
```
```
Enter the student's name: John

```

### Demonstrate List Slicing
```
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
