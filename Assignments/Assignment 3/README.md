# Python Programs for Factorial Calculation and Math Module Usage

## Description
This repository contains two Python programs:

### 1. Calculate Factorial Using a Function
This program defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using recursion. The function is then called with a user-provided input, and the factorial result is displayed.

### 2. Using the Math Module for Calculations
This program asks the user for a number and uses the `math` module to perform the following calculations:
- Square root of the number
- Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
- Sine of the number (in radians)

The calculated results are then displayed.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3 recommended).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```sh
   python filename.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter the required inputs.
5. The program will display the respective outputs.

## Example Usage
### Calculate Factorial
```
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

### Math Module Calculations
```
Enter a number: 16
Square root: 4.0
Logarithm: 2.772588722239781
Sine: -0.2879033166650653
```
