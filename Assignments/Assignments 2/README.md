# Python Programs for Even/Odd Check and Summation

## Description
This repository contains two simple Python programs:

### 1. Check if a Number is Even or Odd
This program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement. It then displays the result accordingly.

### 2. Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50
This program uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50, calculates the sum of all integers in this range, and displays the final sum.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3 recommended).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```sh
   python filename.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter the required inputs.
5. The program will display the respective outputs.

## Example Usage
### Check if a Number is Even or Odd
```
Enter a number: 8
8 is an even number.
```
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.
```

### Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50
